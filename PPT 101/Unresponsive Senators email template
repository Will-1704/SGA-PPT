Good morning Leah,
               
I wanted to forward you a list of Senators who have not yet contacted their RSOs. I have reached out multiple times to these individuals, initially asking them on February 23rd to contact them. If they mention that they forgot to CC me and Charlotte, please have them forward me the emails.
