Here you'll find all the resources that I've accumulated as both Senator and President Pro Tempore. 
I hope you find these useful, and don't hesitate to contact me in you need help or clarification on anything.

**Note- Sometimes the format of certain files won't let you preview them. 
The filename should suffice for you to know what you are downloading, but theres also the links in the transition packet explaining the context behind them.
Have a great year!
